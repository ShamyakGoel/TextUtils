### Textutils is my attempt to reduce time in formatting sentences and paragraphs.
Textutils have following features :-
* Converting text to uppercase
* Converting text to lowercase
* Saving text to memory (browser cache)
* Restoring text from memory (browser cache)

* Saving text to file (.txt extension)
